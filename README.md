Practical assignments for a CS computer graphics 101 course

This material was uploaded here as a reference to students that have assignments on local illumination, raytracing or animation (specifically with shape interpolation). If you were looking for a reference for your studies on computer graphics, I'm glad if I can help. All of the work here has been evaluated in a Computer Graphics 101 course taken in the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil, with A-tier grades.

**Please notice that you must NOT copypaste this code in your assignments.** Even though this is free software and you're able to build upon it as you wish, plagiarism is taken very seriously in practically all education institutions and copying your work from a Github repository and delivering it as if it was yours is still plagiarism. You can get a harsh punishment for that. I'm stating that here because it has happened before and I had to make this repository private for the semester. **If I receive complaints of plagiarism again, I will lock this repository indefinitely.**

Need any explanations or support? Please open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
